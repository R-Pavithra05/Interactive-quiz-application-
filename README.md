DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

The primary objective of this task was to design and implement a user-friendly, responsive quiz web application that allows users to log in, take a timed or untimed quiz, receive instant feedback, and review incorrect answers for learning purposes. The application is designed with simplicity and usability in mind, targeting educational and self-assessment purposes.

Development Tools and Technologies Used:

HTML5: Used to create the structure of all the web pages including login, welcome, quiz, and review pages. It ensures semantic and accessible markup.

CSS3: Applied for layout styling, color schemes, and responsive design. CSS helped create a visually appealing interface with modern UI components.

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript was used to handle the applicationâ€™s interactivity such as user authentication, navigating between pages, evaluating quiz answers, tracking scores, and displaying review content dynamically.

LocalStorage API: The application utilizes the Web Storage API to store and retrieve user-related data like username and quiz performance locally during the session.

SPCK Editor: The code was written and tested using the SPCK editor, a local development environment suited for HTML/CSS/JS development. It provided the flexibility to edit, run, and debug the entire project seamlessly.


Application Workflow:
The user begins at the login page, where they must enter a username and create a password. Upon validation, they are redirected to the welcome page, which displays a personalized greeting and a "Start Quiz" button. Clicking the button transitions to the quiz page, where questions are presented one at a time. After each answer, the user is shown immediate visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect). Once all questions are answered, the user sees a summary score. Finally, they are offered a review page, which shows all questions they answered incorrectly, alongside the correct answers, enabling reflection and learning.

Use Cases:
This application has versatile use in several domains:

Education: It can be used in schools and colleges for quizzes, mock tests, and interactive learning modules.

Corporate Training: Companies can use it to evaluate employee training and assess knowledge retention.

Recruitment: The quiz can be adapted for preliminary screening tests during hiring.

Events & Competitions: It can be embedded in tech fests, hackathons, or college events for general quizzes or technical tests.

Self-Learning Tools: Individuals can use this as a personal project or a tool to prepare for exams.


Conclusion:
The interactive quiz application demonstrates effective use of frontend technologies to create a functional and engaging user experience. With clean separation of logic (via individual JS files), organized project structure, and thoughtful user interaction design, the application stands as a good example of modern web development. It also showcases how basic web technologies can be leveraged to build meaningful tools for learning and evaluation
